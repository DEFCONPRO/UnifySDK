# ZPC Release Notes

## [1.1.1] - Mar 2022

### Added

* Full control for Configuration Command Class, version 4
* Added generated OnOff cluster commands for nodes issuing Basic Set commands to the ZPC.

### Changed

* Changed configuration keys for OTA config, if these have been specified in
  the ZPC config file, they need to be updated to the new keys manually
  * Changed `zpc.ota_chache_path` to `zpc.ota.cache_path`
  * Changed `zpc.ota_chache_size` to `zpc.ota.cache_size`

* Default get retry timer is lowered to 3s instead of 20s to mitigate against Wake
  Up nodes falling asleep during node interviews.

### Fixed

* ZPC gets stuck at reset in some rare cases.
* ZPC stops controlling OnOff if Binary Switch Set without supervision failed.
* ZPC stops granting S2 keys in some cases after a reset.
* ZPC does not let Iot Services control/remove a node after SmartStart self-destruct failure.
* ZPC consider Wake Up node failings if they fell asleep while communicating with them
* Re-interview a Wake Up leads to a difficult to recover situation
* Not all MQTT publications unretained after a node exclusion.
* S2 DSK of the previous node saved again with the next node if it does not support S2.

## [1.1.0] - Feb 2022

### Added

* Partial Control for Central Scene Command Class
  * Populating Scene Attributes to reflect the node's capabilities (total number of scenes)
  * Central Scene is mapped to the Scene Cluster.

* Issuing Generated Commands based on interaction with Z-Wave nodes
  * Issuing RecallScene when receiving Central Scene Notifications.
  * Issuing RF Telemetry reports at each transmission when RF Telemetry is enabled

* Support for RF Telemetry (reporting transmissions events)
* Monitoring if Offline nodes are responding again with regular NOPs commands.
* Network Polling

### Changed

* ZPC datastore file key has been changed from --datastore.file to --zpc.datastore_file
* Default datastore file has been changed from /var/lib/uic/database.db to /var/lib/uic/zpc.db
  * If you used the default configuration, keep your previous database by running `mv /var/lib/uic/database.db /var/lib/uic/zpc.db`

* Increased Z-Wave Tx Queue robustness to multiple Tx sessions.
* Communication with Z-Wave Module optimized

### Fixed

* Interviewing an offline node would make it appear online.
* Missing Wake Up Interval Set during interview for door/window sensor
* ZPC hangs and stops resolving attributes when DevGUI sends a MoveWithOnOff command

|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| UIC-1162  | When device have multiple functionalities on the Z-Wave end, which is mapped to the same ZigBee attribute, the mapping will be incomplete.   | Update the UAM file to avoid overlap.           |
| UIC-1088  | Potentially wrong controller NIF after controller migration.                                          | Usually no problem in practice                  |
| UIC-1603  | When ZPC includes a sleeping device, sometimes the node interview does not succeed and therefore, the full functionality of the node will not be presented to the use. | Wait until the next Wake Up or re-include the node |
| UIC-1697  | Nodes with S2 granted keys sending Reports to Follow will trigger a SPAN increase out-of-sync situation. | No workaround.                               |
| UIC-1785  | Wake Up Nodes sending a Wake Up Notification during bootstrapping get put to sleep without interview.
| Exclude and re-include the node if it happens. |
| UIC-1798  |Â ZPC not able to compile with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release | Build with CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo instead |
