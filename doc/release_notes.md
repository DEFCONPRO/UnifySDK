## [1.2.0] - Aug 2022

### Added

- Shared attribute store helpers to read/write ZCL attributes
- Portable Runtime - allows you to demo a Unify based Z-Wave IoT Gateway on your Windows, Mac or Linux Desktop with the help of Docker containers.
- Binaries for x86_64 has been released - they are unsupported for now.
- New Debian packages:
  - libuic-dev - Unify development header files.
  - uic-cpcd - Silabs Co-Processor Communication Daemon for Linux.
  - uic-cpc-hci-bridge - Bluetooth on host, via chip managed by CPCd.
  - uic-otbr - OpenThread Border Router, via chip managed by CPCd.
  - uic-zigbeed - Zigbee stack on host, via chip managed by CPCd (armhf only).

### Changed

- Attribute Store can be configured runtime to:

  - Save automatically all changes to the Datastore
  - Perform validation of add/write operations based on attribute type registrations

- Attribute Mapper/Utils understand automatically all numerical types in the
attribute store based on type registration.

- Code depending on [GeckoSDK](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk) has been bumped to the latest release version 4.1.0.

- The Debian packages have been put in a combined Zip package - eg. `unify_x.y.z_armhf.zip`.

- Rust version bumped from 1.58.1 to 1.60.0.

- Documentation is now generated by [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) with a [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) theme, similar to subpages on [](docs.silabs.com).

- Build changes:
  - Default builds now includes building CPCd, OTBR and Zigbeed. Relevant build flags to disable these are BUILD_CPCD, BUILD_ZIGBEED and BUILD_OTBR.
  - When building CPCd the [cpc-daemon GitHub repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/cpc-daemon) is automatically fetched by CMake.
  - When building AoX, OTBR, Zigbeed, ZigPC the [GeckoSDK GitHub repo](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/gecko_sdk) is automatically fetched by CMake.

### Fixed

- The naming convention of MQTT client IDs is updated for all Unify applications to `<unify_application>_<pid-of-application>`. Previously this was `uic_<incremented-number>`.

### Known Issues

- **UIC-2261**/**UIC-1341**: Attribute Mapper parent operator navigation does not always work (only on left hand sides)
  _Note_: Avoid using the parent operator in UAM files, and if necessary, double check if it works.
- **UIC-2228**: Attribute Mapper reducer is disabled due to errors. The mapper will not successfully reduce constant expressions.
  _Note_: Avoid unnecessary calculations in the UAM files. e.g. write 100 instead of 10*10
- **UIC-2195**: Attribute Poll reads the ZPC configuration
  _Note_: Do not use the Attribute Poll in your own application at the moment.
- **UIC-2171**: SmartStart manager prints some errors if no SmartStart list is published.
  _Note_: The errors can be ignored, there is no consequence
- **UIC-1725**: Resize a terminal with a running Unify application and a few error messages regarding file descriptors will be displayed.
  _Note_: The errors can be ignored, there is no consequence
- **UIC-1593**: The Dotdot MQTT library does not always use enum names, even though the Unify Specification indicates that it should.
  _Note_: Be tolerant to numbers instead of strings for enums.

## [1.1.1] - Mar 2022

### Added

_No additions._

### Changed

_No changes._

### Fixed

- Running with command line parameter`--dump-config` now dumps proper YAML.
Before it would only dump max 2 level objects, e.g. `zpc.poll.xxx`
parameters was before dumped as:

```yaml
  zpc:
    poll.attribute_list_file: "/usr/share/uic/zwave_poll_config.yaml"
    poll.backoff: 30
    poll.default_interval: 60
```

and now it is dumped as:

```yaml
  zpc:
    poll:
      attribute_list_file: "/usr/share/uic/zwave_poll_config.yaml"
      backoff: 30
      default_interval: 60
```

### Known Issues

_No known issues._

## [1.1.0] - Feb 2022

### Added

- A new component, Gecko Bootloader Interface (uic_gbl_interface), for performing OTA updates
- A new component, Attribute Polling Engine (unify_attribute_poll), supplies the functionality of polling attribute reported values with a supplied interval.
- A new application, Name and Location (nal), for devices name and location management.
- A new application, Unify Packet Trace Interface Capture (upti_cap), to communicate with Silicon Labs WSTK adapters and publish debug channel messages to a MQTT broker.
